This is the source code for my personal website.  Nothing too exciting yet...

nicoleblumhorst.com is now up and running! It is being hosted on my Raspberry Pi :)

I plan to add:
1. A bucket list [done](nicoleblumhorst.com/bucketList)
2. Some sort of travel blog type thing (not really a full blog though)
3. ...I think that is all I have plans for right now...
